Script Name: `lnx_arch_frmwr_audit_v1.01.sh`
Description:
  This script automates the process of detecting hardware, identifying and installing necessary firmware,
  updating a configuration file with the current status of drivers and firmware, and logging the entire process.
  It is designed to be run on Arch Linux systems.

Usage:
  Run the script with administrative privileges: sudo ./FirmwareUpdater.sh
  Follow the on-screen prompts to proceed with each step.

Features:
  - Hardware detection and firmware mapping
  - Firmware installation from AUR
  - Configuration file updates for current firmware status
  - System configuration adjustments
  - Detailed logging and error handling
  - User confirmation prompts for critical actions

Best Practices:
  - Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
  - Backup your system before running this script.
  - Review the log file after execution for any warnings or errors.

### **TODO**:
# ~ **Database/API for Hardware Mapping**: Research and identify a database or an API that provides comprehensive mappings\n 
# between hardware components and their required firmware. This could be a publicly available database or a vendor-provided API.
# ~ **Parsing Tools Output**: Develop logic to parse the output of `lspci`, `lsusb`, and `lshw` commands to extract hardware details.
# ~ **Mapping Logic**: Once we have hardware details, create a mapping function to match these details against the database/API\n 
# to find the corresponding firmware.
# ~ **Handling Edge Cases**: Ensure that the logic handles various hardware types, including those without firmware requirements.
# ~ **Updating the Script**: Once we have the mapping logic, integrate it into the `detect_hardware_and_firmware()` function of the script.

### **Next Steps**:
# - Research databases or APIs for hardware-to-firmware mappings.
# - Develop parsing logic for `lspci`, `lsusb`, and `lshw`.
# - Implement the mapping logic and integrate it into `detect_hardware_and_firmware()`.
# - Test each development step in a controlled environment.
